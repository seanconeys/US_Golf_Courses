# US_Golf_Course
This repository contains a datset compilied by me with information on every golf course in America, the scraper used to make the dataset,
and a small exploration of the data. The exploration is very general as the purpose of this repo is mainly to display my scraping and graphing skills.
A exploration generally has a question or set of questions in mind that drive the investigation but here it is very general because there are no such questions. I.e if you are trying to decide whether 
to make a private or public golf course you might want to graph the avg rounds, price, and average revenue for both types of courses.
If you're looking for where to build a golf course you might see compare what states have the most rounds played per year etc. 

Jupyter Notebooks often have issues loading on github. If issues occur the adress of the notebook can be copy and pasted into the notebook viewer on the jupyter website: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/
