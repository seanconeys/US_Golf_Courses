# US_Golf_Course
This repository contains a datset compilied by me containing information on golf courses in America, the scraper used to make the dataset,
graphs done for the presentation in python and tableau, and the actual presentation in powerpoint.

I recommend viewing my video of the presentation at https://youtu.be/4q1nNz3P4oo as much of the insight is in what I say and not just the graphs. If you don't want to view the video I recommend viewing the powerpoint itself because the tableau book and jupyter notbook are not necessarily organized or explained and were only used as sources for the presentation itself.

Jupyter Notebooks often have issues loading on github. If issues occur the adress of the notebook can be copy and pasted into the notebook viewer on the jupyter website: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/
