# US_Golf_Course
This repository contains a datset with information on every golf course in America, the scraper to make the dataset,
and a small exploration of the data. The exploration is very general as the purpose of this repo is mainly to display my scraping and graphing skills.
A exploration generally has a question or set of questions in mind that drive the investigation. I.e if you are trying to decide whether 
to make a private or public golf course you might want to graph the avg rounds, price, and average revenue for both types of courses.
If you're looking for where to build a golf course you might see compare what states have the most rounds played per year etc.
